The goal of this program is to send the email to users whose status are activated in the excel file.


There are four files, including Data_Processing.py, Email_Sending.py, and the GUI.py, and an excel file which contains some information of the users. The purpose of each file is descried at the first few lines in the file.


NOTICE:
There are some places you need to change at first. At line15 in Email_Sending.py, you need to change the default setting of the name of the sender and the password. Also don't forget to change the password at line65 in GUI.py.
